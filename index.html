    <p>
      The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) was established as the National Science and Development Board (NSDB) on June 13, 1958. It was later reconstituted as the National Science and Technology Authority (NSTA) in 1981 and elevated to cabinet-level status in 1987, becoming the DOST we know today.
